# ePop
 A simple tool written for one single situation: logging contracts.
 
 To run, simply download the project and direct your terminal to the ePop folder. Then, run `>python epop.py`

Note: For demo purposes I've included a few sample contracts. The documents are ordinarily about 7 pages long, but I've chosen to only include the necessary information for privacy/conciseness reasons.
